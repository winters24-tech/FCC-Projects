  <p id="main"> The day I fell in love with the game of basketball was when I first watch a man named Allen Iverson who is nicknamed "the Answer" and "AI" play during his early years for a team called the 76ers. Being able to hear so many commentators say how small he is compared to everyone and still watch him do everything on court was phenominal to see. With me being a smaller guy it added a spark in me to want to be just like him. If you don't know who he is by now let me break it down and show few images of him vs the all-time greats. Enjoy!</p>

<p id="conclusion">
  Iverson also starred in a few different movie films such as:Like Mike (2002), Imagine That (2009), and My Other Home (2017). With quite a fulfilled career all the while being told "you're to small to compete" you can see how he became my favorite player and the reason I grew a major liking into basketball. Congrats to him and his awards, honors and achievement and thank you Allen Iverson for showing us that "only the strong survive."
